# Adamant
This is the Adamant Task Manager, as proposed in my final bachelor thesis for the Bachelor of Computer Science of the University of London.

## Getting started
You require credentials to Firebase to run this application locally. If you are here to grade, you can take the credentials in `.env.grader` and paste them in your `.env` file. These credentials will be invalidated in the future and are only available to give anyone accessing this material for the bachelor thesis the same environment to work in.

To start the application, first, install the dependencies:
```zsh
npm install
```

Then, run the application:
```zsh
npm run start
```
